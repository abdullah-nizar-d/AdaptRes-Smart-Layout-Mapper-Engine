AdaptRes Smart Layout Mapper Engine

A smart layout mapping engine for adaptive user interfaces on external displays.


---

‚ú® Key Features

Dynamic Layout Mapping: Automatically adjusts the layout for displays with different aspect ratios and resolutions.

Efficient Layout Caching: Computes and caches pixel values once per resolution, reducing CPU load.

Cross-Resolution Adaptation: Seamlessly adapts UI to a wide range of display resolutions.

üìù Description

The AdaptRes Smart Layout Mapper Engine enables seamless UI projection from a main device to an external display by intelligently adapting the content to the target display's resolution.

Unlike traditional methods that continuously compute resolution-based adjustments for UI element positions and sizes, AdaptRes performs this high-load computation only once per resolution change. The results are stored in memory, allowing for faster layout updates and reduced processing load.

üöÄ How It Works

1. External Display Detected: The engine detects a connected external display and reads its resolution.

2. Precomputation of Percentages: It computes percentage values (1% to 100%) for the screen width and height.

3. UI Positioning and Resizing: Converts percentage-based positions and sizes of UI elements into pixel values.

4. Caching: Stores precomputed pixel values in memory to avoid repetitive calculations.

5. Display Disconnected: Clears cached layout data when the display is disconnected.
